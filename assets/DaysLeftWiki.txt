<p>Days Left originally started off as an Epic written by Brock Johnson, Tyson Gibson, and Tyson's friend Chole.
The original plot behind Days Left was all over the place, for example, Brock's geometry teacher at the time, Ms. Hagerman, served as the main villain for the first book/epic. Ms. Hagerman was selected as the villain because Brock really REALLY hated her. Ms. Hagerman was pretty much the center of alot of stress Brock endured throughout his freshman and Junior years in Highschool. Even to this day, Brock will not rewrite the first book since it was his passion project that took months on end to complete. To fans of his channel, SH3LL SH0CK3D, The first Days Left is considered to be the holy bible that connects all of the SH3LL SH0CK3D universes together. At the time, Brock was inspired by books like The Great Gatsby, and 1984. Brock wanted to write a "masterpiece" of his own. Since Brock's brother took his PS4 away, and he was getting fed up with his geometry teacher's constant BS, Brock decided to take his anger out in Days Left. His geometry teacher, who is the main villain, was portreyed as a Meth addicted prostitute who was in an affair with satan. Brock took very creative liberties when making the world and characters in Days Left. He took inspiration from Hideo Kojima, legendary game director of games like Metal Gear and Silent HILL, when desigining the lore behind Days Left. This let Brock had complete creative freedom behind his story and how he wanted to present it. However, this might've been too much of a good thing, since while writing Days Left, Brock would always run into plot holes he created with the characters. So ultimately characters would have some weird bizzare power that would try to cover up any plot holes.
